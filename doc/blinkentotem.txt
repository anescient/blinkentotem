Blinkenlights aren't what they used to be.
Computers don't have enough blinkenlights.

This is not blinkenlights:
(neon rainbow gamer rig)
That's just ground effects.
(rice car)
Blinkenlights tell you something about the machine's state and activity, like an instrument panel.
Though neat-o, they've been on a steady decline from the start.
Back in the day every -bit- had its own light.
These days you're lucky if you have a single disk activity light.


I've used software widgets.
Some windows 2000 thing?

My screenlets
This screenlet renders a panel of LED thingies.
It takes high framerate animation to make proper short flashes; it's barely worth it.
There's no substitute for actual flashing LEDs.



In the future I'll add this:
(20x2 display)
Then I can do RAM, top process, network activity, etc.
It supports custom characters, and it can be updated in small pieces, so animations, probably, too.
